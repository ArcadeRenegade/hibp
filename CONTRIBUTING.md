# Contributing

If you would like to contribute code to this project, you can do so by forking
the repository and sending a merge request.

When submitting code, please make every effort to follow existing conventions
and style in order to keep the code as readable as possible. This project
adheres to the [SemiStandard](https://github.com/Flet/semistandard) code style,
with a few additional rules:

* Avoid lines longer than **80** characters
* Line continuations are indented 4 spaces
* No spaces within brackets (e.g. `[0, 1] // correct`)
* No spaces within object literal braces (e.g. `{a: 2} // correct`)

If adding new functionality, please be sure to include the appropriate tests
as well. All tests must pass before a merge can be accepted.

Thank you.
